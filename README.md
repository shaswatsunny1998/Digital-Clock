- Create a function which will do all of the work to calculate and show the time.
- Use the [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) Library in Javascript to retrieve the current date and time information. Use the different methods that are provided to you for retrieving the individual hour, minute and second information.
- Use the [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) method to utilize the function you've created to update each second.

Your solution will include one CSS file -
[CSS file](https://github.com/shaswatsunny1998/Digital-Clock/blob/master/style.css) which contains your page styles, one [JS file](https://github.com/shaswatsunny1998/Digital-Clock/blob/master/script.js) which contains your clock logic and one HTML file which contains your page structure and loads the CSS and JS resources.
